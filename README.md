In this repository I have stored all of my data analytics works which I have done during internship at ApexPlanet. During this data analytics internship I have worked accross many datasets and found various useful insights and some of most linking and impressive things I have placed in this repository .

<h1>TASK - 1</h1>
<h2>Data Immersion & Wrangling</h2>

<h3>Objective:</h3>
To rapidly acquaint the intern with the provided dataset and master the critical first step of any analysis: acquiring, cleaning, and preparing data
for analysis.

<h3>Steps:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
 Data Access and Familarization
Grant the intern access to a key dataset (e.g., sales transactions, website analytics, customer data). The intern will create a data dictionary,
documenting each variable's meaning, type, and potential business relevance.
  </li>
  <li>
 Data quality assessment
The intern will perform an initial profiling of the data to identify critical issues: missing values, duplicates,
inconsistent formatting, and outliers.
</li>
<li>
 Data cleaning and familiarization
  <ul>
<li>Write scripts (e.g., in Python/Pandas or SQL) to handle identified data quality issues.</li> 
<li>Perform necessary transformations: standardizing date formats, categorizing free-text fields, and feature engineering (e.g., creating new columns like 'Customer Age' from a 'Date of Birth' column).</li>
<li>Output a final, analysis-ready dataset.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ol>
