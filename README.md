In this repository I have stored all of my data analytics works which I have done during internship at ApexPlanet. During this data analytics internship I have worked accross many datasets and found various useful insights and some of most linking and impressive things I have placed in this repository .

<h1>TASK - 1</h1>
<h2>Data Immersion & Wrangling</h2>

<h3>Objective:</h3>
To rapidly acquaint the intern with the provided dataset and master the critical first step of any analysis: acquiring, cleaning, and preparing data
for analysis.

<h3>Steps:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
 Data Access and Familarization
Grant the intern access to a key dataset (e.g., sales transactions, website analytics, customer data). The intern will create a data dictionary,
documenting each variable's meaning, type, and potential business relevance.
  </li>
  <li>
 Data quality assessment
The intern will perform an initial profiling of the data to identify critical issues: missing values, duplicates,
inconsistent formatting, and outliers.
</li>
<li>
 Data cleaning and familiarization
  <ul>
<li>Write scripts (e.g., in Python/Pandas or SQL) to handle identified data quality issues.</li> 
<li>Perform necessary transformations: standardizing date formats, categorizing free-text fields, and feature engineering (e.g., creating new columns like 'Customer Age' from a 'Date of Birth' column).</li>
<li>Output a final, analysis-ready dataset.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h1>TASK - 2</h1>
<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Business Intelligence</h2>

<h3>Objective</h3>
To uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data and develop proficiency in SQL for data extraction and basic dashboarding.

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
Descriptive Statistics & Univariate Analysis :
Calculate and interpret key summary statistics for numerical and categorical fields. Create initial visualizations (histograms, bar charts) to
understand distributions.
  </li>
    <li>
 SQL for Business Questions :
*Provide the intern with a list of 5-7 specific business questions (e.g., 
"What are the top 5 products by revenue in the last 6 months?"
,
"What
is the monthly user acquisition trend?").
*The intern will write and execute SQL queries to answer these questions, focusing on filtering, aggregation, and multi-table joins. 
    </li>
    <li>
 Multivariate Analysis & Correlation :
Create advanced visualizations (scatter plots, heatmaps, pair plots) to explore relationships between
two or more variables (e.g., marketing spend vs. sales, age vs. product category).
    </li>
  <li>
Static Dashboard Mock-up :
Using the insights from EDA, the intern will create a static mock-up (in PowerPoint/Google Slides or
Excel) of a key metrics dashboard, proposing the most important KPIs to track.
  </li>
